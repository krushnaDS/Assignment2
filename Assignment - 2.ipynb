    "1. Single-Line Comment : Python single-line comment starts with the hashtag symbol (#) with no white spaces and lasts till the                           end of the line. If the comment exceeds one line then put a hashtag on the next line and continue the                           Python Comments. Python’s single-line comments are proved useful for supplying short explanations for                           variables, function declarations, and expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-Line Comment : Python multiline comments can also be enclosed in a delimiter (“””). Again there should be no white                             space between delimiters (“””). They are useful when the comment text does not fit into one line,                               therefore needs to span across lines. This type of string literal gets ignored as it is not assigned to                         any variable."
